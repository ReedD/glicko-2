# Glicko 2

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/glicko-two.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glicko-two)


The Glicko-2 rating system is a method for assessing a player's strength in games of skill, such as chess and Go. It was invented by [Mark Glickman](http://www.glicko.net) as an improvement of the Elo rating system, and initially intended for the primary use as a chess rating system. Glickman's principal contribution to measurement is "ratings reliability", called RD, for ratings deviation. You can read the full Glicko-2 documentation/specification [here](http://glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf).

## Install

`yarn add glicko-two`

## Basic Usage

The following illustrates the most basic low-level usage of this npm package:

```typescript
import Player, { Outcome } from 'glicko-two';

const mike = new Player({
  defaultRating: 1500,
  rating: 1600,
  ratingDeviation: 350,
  tau: 0.5,
  volatility: 0.06,
});

const kyle = new Player({
  defaultRating: 1500,
  rating: 1500,
  ratingDeviation: 350,
  tau: 0.5,
  volatility: 0.06,
});

// Add results to mike
mike.addResult(kyle, Outcome.Win);
mike.addResult(kyle, Outcome.Loss);
mike.addResult(kyle, Outcome.Tie);
// Add results to kyle
kyle.addResult(mike, Outcome.Loss);
kyle.addResult(mike, Outcome.Win);
kyle.addResult(mike, Outcome.Tie);

// Update their ratings
mike.updateRating();
kyle.updateRating();

// mike -> {
//   "rating": 1542,
//   "ratingDeviation": 230.15,
//   "volatility": 0.059998
// }
// kyle -> {
//   "rating": 1558,
//   "ratingDeviation": 230.15,
//   "volatility": 0.059998
// }
```

To simplify the usage of the above code we can do the following:

```typescript
import { createPlayerFactory, Match } from 'glicko-two';

// First we can create a player factory with the
// defaults we want set for each of our players
// (all option values below are the defaults)
const createPlayer = createPlayerFactory({
  defaultRating: 1500,
  defaultRatingDeviation: 350,
  defaultVolatility: 0.06,
  tau: 0.5,
});

// We can use the factory to generate players
const mike = createPlayer({ rating: 1600 });
const kyle = createPlayer();

const match = new Match(mike, kyle);
match.reportTeamAWon(); // mike won
match.reportTeamBWon(); // kyle won
match.reportTie(); // tie
match.updatePlayerRatings();
// The results are the same as in the first example above
// mike -> {
//   "rating": 1542,
//   "ratingDeviation": 230.15,
//   "volatility": 0.059998
// }
// kyle -> {
//   "rating": 1558,
//   "ratingDeviation": 230.15,
//   "volatility": 0.059998
// }
```

Additionally you may also simply report outcomes numerically one at a time:

```typescript
const match = new Match(mike, kyle);
match.reportOutcome([5, 3]); // mike won
match.reportOutcome([2, 7]); // kyle won
match.reportOutcome([6, 6]); // tie
match.updatePlayerRatings();
```

Or in bulk:

```typescript
const match = new Match(mike, kyle);
match.reportOutcomes([
  [5, 3], // mike won
  [2, 7], // kyle won
  [6, 6], // tie
]);
match.updatePlayerRatings();
```

## Advanced Usage

The `Match` class also supports team ranking by using the "composite player" update method. This method is not apart of the original Glicko-2 specification. How you apply ranking updates to a player that's apart of a team is up for debate and depends heavily on your use case.

> The Composite Opponent Update Method considers each outcome as a match against a single player possessing the average rating and deviation of the opposing team players. In effect, the update method creates a composite player out of the opposing team and uses this playerâ€™s resulting rating and deviation when updating a player. - [Garrick J. Williams](http://rhetoricstudios.com/downloads/AbstractingGlicko2ForTeamGames.pdf)

```typescript
import { createPlayerFactory, Match } from 'glicko-two';

const createPlayer = createPlayerFactory();

const aTeam = [
  createPlayer({ rating: 1800 }),
  createPlayer({ rating: 1500 }),
  createPlayer({ rating: 1600 }),
];

const bTeam = [
  createPlayer({ rating: 1700 }),
  createPlayer({ rating: 900 }),
  createPlayer({ rating: 1550 }),
];

const match = new Match(aTeam, bTeam);
match.reportTeamAWon();
match.reportTeamAWon();
match.reportTeamBWon();
match.reportTeamAWon();
match.updatePlayerRatings();
```

## When to update rankings

Generally speaking, the system was designed to allow for a series of zero to many games played within a set rating period interval. At the end of the rating period, all players ratings would be updated. The rating interval length is up to the administrator.

> The Glicko-2 system works best when the number of games in a rating period is moderate to large, say an average of at least 10-15 games per player in a rating period. - [Mark E. Glickman](http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf)

However, this is not always the case [lichess](https://lichess.org/qa/888/what-is-glicko-2-rating-volatility#answer-5619) for example updates after every single match.

## Credit

The translation of the Glicko-2 algorithm from spec to JavaScript was largely the work of an existing NPM package [glicko2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glicko2).
